                                        We are selling per rising bid. Currency is South African Rand.  On the fall of the hammer, the highest bidder (the “Purchaser”) is bound to his Agreement of Sale  The Seller (the applicable status will be announced): is a VAT vendor which means that VAT, calculated at 15% of the purchase price, will be payable; or is not a VAT vendor which means that normal duties will be payable to the Receiver of Revenue.
                                        If the Reserve price is met, the auction becomes absolute and the property is sold to the highest bidder and an Agreement of Sale is concluded (Regulation 28(8) of the CPA). In the event that the highest bid falls short of the Reserve price, the Auctioneer will, in terms of regulation  28(6) of the CPA, knock the property “subject to confirmation” in order to allow the Seller to confirm or reject the highest bidder’s offer during the acceptance period. The acceptance period in this instance

                                    <p>Unless otherwise stated, all Properties at an auction has a minimum selling price established by the Seller (“Reserve Price”). The starting bid is not the Reserve Price. Auction-Prop may counter bid on behalf of the Seller on any Property up to, but not exceeding, the amount of the Reserve Price, and no such bid will result in a sale of the Property. If the Reserve Price is not met, the Seller is under no obligation to sell the Property; however, the Seller may accept a bid that is below the Reserve Price in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>

                                    <p>For Properties to be marketed in a Closed Bid Event, Participants are invited by Auction-Prop or the Seller to submit a non-binding indicative bid (“Indicative Bid”) before the Closed Bid Event. In order to submit an Indicative Bid, Participant must complete an Indicative Bid Form posted on the Property Page prior to the auction date.

                                    <p>The extension of time will allow for delays in bids reaching the platform due to connection challenges. If a bid is made within 60 seconds of the closing time of the online auction, the timer will automatically add another 60 seconds onto the auction timer. This process will repeat until no more bids are received. Auction-Prop may extend the time for bidding in any auction Event in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
